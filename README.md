# Campus Insider

Campus Insider is designed to facilitate resource sharing and collaboration within a university campus.

The platform focuses on three main features:

- Peer-to-peer equipment loans
- Carpool ride organization

This project is currently under active development and is intended to demonstrate clean backend architecture and business-oriented design.
